                    <h2>National History</h2>
                    <p>Alpha Phi Gamma is the first Asian American sorority, established on February 1, 1994, at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. The Seven Sisters who founded the sorority are Allex Choi, Candy Cunanan, Christine Nguyen, Sandie Rillera, Kolleen Kim, Grace Hsieh, and Jennifer Oku. Through their hard work and determination, the sorority is now recognized as the first Asian Greek Sorority at Cal Poly Pomona. These Sisters wanted to bring together all women of different nationalities through the bonds of friendship and Sisterhood. Alpha Phi Gamma was established to promote service and Asian Awareness to the University and to the community. The Sorority’s basis is its pride in being open to new ideas and the understanding of the lifestyle of an Asian American woman.</p>

                <h2>Charter History</h2>
                <p>Alpha Phi Gamma’s colony at Arizona State University was chartered on May 21st, 2017 by eleven sisters: Diana Cai, Lydia Chew, Jennifer Doan, Danielle Ganon, Lynn Huynh, Erin Kong, Madison Mitzner, Tracy Ngo, Eileen Nguyen, Hearthy Nguyen, and Jonie Sales. The Charter Class evolved from the Asian American Women’s Association (AAWA), an interest group that ultimately created and unified eleven women to form the Charter “C.R.E.A.M.”Class. The Potential New Member Mom: Jena Junsay (UNLV), and Ritual Chancellor: Nicole Wong (CPP), and Big Sisters of the expansion team guided them through the new member process and helped them successfully cross into the Sisterhood. On June 20th, 2020 the Charter at Arizona State University was granted Chapter status and was declared Xi Chapter.</p>
                <p>Alpha Phi Gamma at Arizona State University prides itself in promoting Asian awareness, as well as encouraging young women to strive for excellence. Our Sisters value kindness in addition to academic excellence, philanthropy, and community involvement. Through hard work and dedication, our sisters at Arizona State University utilize Alpha Phi Gamma’s platform to stand in solidarity with our fellow marginalized persons and demand social, economic, and political equality for all.</p>
