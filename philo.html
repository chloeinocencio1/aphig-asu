                <h2>National Philanthropy</h2>
                <p>Alpha Phi Gamma’s National Philanthropy is the Fight Against Violence Towards Women. Since its creation at the First National Conference in 1999, the Sisters of Alpha Phi Gamma have fought for the women who could not fight for themselves; in 2009, Alpha Phi Gamma strengthened their commitment by becoming a member of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.</p>

                <h2>Our Project</h2>
                <p>The Sisters of the Charter “C.R.E.A.M.” Class organized a philanthropy event during the spring semester of 2017 where passersby were invited to learn more about domestic violence prevention and outline their own hand prints to express solidarity in the Fight Against Violence Towards Women.</p>
                <p>This October, which is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we invited the students of ASU to leave a handprint on our banner. The medium purple handprints represented the people who supported the fight against domestic violence, the pink meant that the person knows someone who has been a victim of violence, and the dark purple color were for victims of domestic violence.</p>

            <h2>Statistics</h2>
            <p>Every year, more than 10 million women and men in the United States are physically abused by an intimate partner—or 20 people per minute—yet only 34% of those who are injured receive medical care. 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men have been victims of some form of physical violence by an intimate partner, a crime that is often unreported and seldom prosecuted.</p>
            <p>Domestic violence affects everyone, but it disproportionately harms women of color, LGBTQIA+ persons, the disabled community, and women living below the poverty line.</p>
